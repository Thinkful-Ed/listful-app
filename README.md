# Listful: A shopping list app


A simple shopping list API meant to provide a backend for students learning front end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.

[Full API spec available here](#tbd)

Note one oddity: when new list items are created, you don't need to supply the `checked` attribute in the request body. New items get created with `checked` set to `false`, by default.
